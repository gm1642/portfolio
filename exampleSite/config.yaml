    content: |-
     ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast whoâ€™s absolutely smitten with Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Embedded Systems. You know, the kind of person who gets a kick out of implementing complex computer vision models on an Nvidia Jetson Nano. ðŸš€
     My journey has been quite an adventure, filled with sensors of all shapes and sizes, actuators that move in mysterious ways, and a whole lot of debugging.
     Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working with some fantastic teams, and together, weâ€™ve brought to life some pretty cool embedded projects. Ever heard of a robotic arm that moves just right or an OTP-Based Smart Lock thatâ€™s as secure as a vault? Yep, we did that! ðŸ¤–ðŸ”’
     Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into the fascinating world of ADAS and Telematics. Itâ€™s like exploring a new planet, but instead of a spaceship, Iâ€™ve got Matlab and Simulink as my trusty companions. ðŸŒŒ
     So, thatâ€™s a little bit about me. Just a tech lover, exploring the universe one line of code at a time. ðŸŒ
