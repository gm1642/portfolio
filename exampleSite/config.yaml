    content: |-
      üëã Hey there! I‚Äôm Umar Ali Khan ‚Äî a curious mind who thrives where circuits meet code and algorithms meet real life. I‚Äôm fascinated by Embedded Systems, Generative AI, and Deep Learning ‚Äî the kind of person who loves squeezing a neural network onto an ESP32-S3 just to see how far edge intelligence can go. ‚öôÔ∏èü§ñ 

      My journey‚Äôs been packed with adventures ‚Äî from building real-time YOLOv8 vision systems on the Jetson Nano to developing smart footwear prototypes that track gait, balance, and recovery through biomechanical sensors and ML models. Working with Taipei Medical University gave me the thrill of blending AI with healthcare, where I explored Explainable AI and time-series deep learning to predict ICU sepsis outcomes. üß†üí°

      I‚Äôve also had my hands deep in the world of Generative AI ‚Äî designing RAG-based chatbots for Continental Automotive and AMULATE Program, crafting pipelines with LangChain, Ollama, and Docker that turn data into intelligent, conversational insights.

      Whether it‚Äôs optimizing sensor power efficiency, experimenting with multimodal AR/VR telepresence robots, or diving into human‚ÄìAI collaboration, I‚Äôm driven by one goal ‚Äî to create technology that feels alive. üåç‚ú®

      So yeah, just an electronics engineer exploring the universe of AI, one embedded device and one model at a time. üöÄ
